# Overview of the Project

#### McMinnville, Oregon is famous for its UFO sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. Dana, a data journalist, has the opportunity to write about her hometown and plans to use Javascript to display her data about UFOs. However, because there is so much data, sifting through it without any adjustments would be a challenge. JavaScript provides a way to manipulate the data by adding filters.

## Deliverable 1 - Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

#### Dana’s finished website includes documented sightings across the United States and Canada. She has also included filters—such as date, city, state, country, shape, and duration—to make her site more user-friendly.

## Summary

#### Dana has created a fantastic initial website. One drawback however, is her data is static. She might want to consider incorporating a dynamic database in future designs so users have the most recent UFO-related information. Dana may also want to include images as a filter in the next version of her web design. She identifies the shape, but a photo or image of the event would be a great addition.
