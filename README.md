# Overview of the Project

#### McMinnville, Oregon is famous for its UFO sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. Dana, a data journalist, has the opportunity to write about her hometown and plans to use Javascript to display her data about UFOs. However, because there is so much data, sifting through it without any adjustments would be a challenge. JavaScript provides a way to manipulate the data by adding filters.

## Deliverable 1 - Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

#### Dana’s finished website includes documented sightings across the United States and Canada. She has also included filters—such as date, city, state, country, shape, and duration—to make her site more user-friendly.
